# Elastic Collisions of two particles
We will have two reference frames: One, where we are actually doing the measurements, which we call the **LAB** frame; the other, in which the center of mass is fixed, which we call the **CM** frame.

As for definitions, 

$\vec{u}_{i} =$ initial velocity in lab frame

$\vec{v}_{i}=$ final velocity in lab frame

$\vec{v}_{i}' =$ initial velocity in CM frame

$\vec{u}_{i}'=$ final velocity in CM frame

$\vec{V} =$ velocity of the CM in the lab frame

$\psi =$ angle in which $m_1$ is deflected by in lab frame
$\zeta =$ angle in which $m_2$ is reflect in the lab frame
$\theta =$ angle in which $m_1$ and $m_2$ are reflected in CM frame.

The picture will help

## Beyond definitions

We know that:

$$m_{1}\vec{r}_{1}+m_2\vec{r}_{2}= M \vec{R}$$

And we can differentiate this with respect to time. If we remember that the second mass is at rest by definition, we will have that:

$$m_{1}\vec{u_{1}}= M \vec{V} $$

That is, 

$$-\vec{u}_{2}' = \vec{V} = \frac{m_{1}\vec{u_1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$$
