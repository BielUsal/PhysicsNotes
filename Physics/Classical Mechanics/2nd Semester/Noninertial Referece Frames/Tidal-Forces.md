# TidaM Forces

Let's suppose we have a system likes this, the moon-earth system. What are the forces involved?

- The force of the earth on the object, $m \vec{g}$ 
- Of the moon on the thing $-G M_{M} m \frac{\hat{r_I}}{r^{2}_I}$ 
- By the acceleration of the earth caused by the moon, $\vec{A} =-G M_{M} \frac{\hat{r}}{r^{2}}$

By Newton's Second Law, we get that:

$$m\ddot{\vec{r}} = \vec{F} - m\vec{A} =  -gM_{M}m\left(\frac{\hat{r}}{r^{2}}- \frac{\hat{r_I}}{r_{I}^{2}}\right)+ m\vec{g}$$
Where we define $F_{tidal} = -gM_{L}m\left(\frac{\hat{r}}{r^{2}}- \frac{\hat{r_I}}{r_{I}^{2}}\right)$, and we can therefore define:

$$U = mgh + mGM_{m}\left(\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r_{I}}\right)$$
And we can continue on for a little bit and get some interesting approximations
