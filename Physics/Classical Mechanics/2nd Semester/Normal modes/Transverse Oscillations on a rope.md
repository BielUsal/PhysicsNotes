## Homogeneous rope of point-masses
Let's consider a rope of length $(n+1)l$ ,subject to a tension $F$ at both ends and composed of $n$ evenly spaced masses at a distance $l$. Our generalized coordinates will be displacements from equilibrium, $(y_1,...,y_n)$, and therefore, our kinetic energy will be:

$$T = \frac{1}{2}m (\dot{y}_{1}^{2} + \dot{y}_{2}^{2} + ... +\dot{y}_{n}^{2})$$
