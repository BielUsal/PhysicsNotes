# Small Oscillations and Normal Modes

Well, this will be a pretty deep dive into the theory of small:

## A review of [[Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics]]
This will be the formalism in which we deal with our problems, so a directed review is in order

## Our assumptions:
We will have to assume quite a few things for everything to go smoothly:

- Potentials that do not depend on the velocity (No E&M :( )
- We will be restricting ourselves to small oscillations around (stable or unstable) equilibrium points

## Our best friend: [[The Harmonic Oscillator in 1D]]
This is where the physics comes into its own, artistically and commercially.

## The [[Linearization of the Equations of Movement]]

We will use the framework of analytical mechanics in holonomous system with schleronomous constraints. This will be a fat one, since it sets the ground rules, applies them and gives us what to work with for the rest of this section

## The simpler case: [[Undampened oscillations]]
Here, we won't have to worry about the pesky velocity terms.
