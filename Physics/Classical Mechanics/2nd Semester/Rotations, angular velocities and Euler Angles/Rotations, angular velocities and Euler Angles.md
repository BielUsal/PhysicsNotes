# Rotations, angular velocities and Euler Angles
These notes are frankly very bad.  Do not use them for anything

## [[Infinitesimal rotations]]
Let's rotate, but just by a little bit

## [[SO(3)]]
Let's get out of 2D land.
## [[Passive v. Active transformations]]
What is the difference between rotating your frame and rotating something?


## [[Euler Angles]]
