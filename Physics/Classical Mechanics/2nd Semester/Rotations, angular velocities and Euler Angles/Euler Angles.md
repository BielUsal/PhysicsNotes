# Euler Angles

If we skip some of the finer details and squint our eyes a little bit, it is easy to see that since $SO(3)$ is $SO(3)$, it has 3 degrees of freedom (equivalently, dimension 3), and I think that Frankel proves it in the beginning of his diff. geometry book.

So, any general rotation can be generated by 3 rotations by angles $(\phi, \theta, \psi)$, and we call the set of those 3 the _Euler Angles_, represented below.

## Finite Rotations of a coordinate system

Let $\{ \vec{e}_1,\vec{e}_2,\vec{e}_3\}$  be our (un-rotated) coordinate system.

Then, for every position vector, we know that:

$$\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}$$
Therefore, we know that:

$$\frac{d \vec{e}_{j}}{dt} = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{e}_{j}$$

Now, let's rotate:

$$\vec{e}_{j}' = R \vec{e}_{j}= \vec{e}_{j} + d\vec{e}_{j} $$ But since $R = \mathbb{1} + \eta$ , where $\eta^{T} =-\eta$ 
By some manipulation, we eget that:

$$d\vec{e}_{j}= d\phi \epsilon_{ijl} n_{i} e_{l}$$
