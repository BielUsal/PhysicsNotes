# Diagonalizing Moments of Inertia
Let's say we have a $\boldsymbol{L} = (L^1,L^2,L^3)$ and we move to a coordinate system in which the moments of inertia are diagonal:




$$L_{1}= I \omega_{1}$$
$$L_{2}= I \omega_{2}$$
$$L_{3}= I \omega_{3}$$
And this just becomes a usual eigenvalue-vector problem with eigenvalues $I$. Not gonna do the whole shtick, if you want more info I probably detailed it more in the [[Small Oscilations and Normal Modes]] section and [[Linear Systems of Equations]].
