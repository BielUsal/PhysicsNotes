### Rotating our coordinate systems
We know that, since $L^i$ and $\omega^i$ are vectors, they must transform contravariantly under a rotation of our coordinate system, that is:
$$L^{k} = \Lambda^{k}_{m}L'^m$$
$$\omega^{l} = \Lambda^{l}_{i} \omega'^j$$

but we also know that:

$$L^{k} = I^{k}_{l} \omega^{l}$$
Therefore;

$$L'^{m} \Lambda^{k}_{m} = 
$$
