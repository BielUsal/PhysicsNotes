# Rigid Bodies
Let's combine the first and last themes, but instead of 3 (possibly weakly) coupled masses we will have $N$ (big number) particles that are *very strongly* coupled, such that their distance remains constant. 

## [[Basic Definitions for rigid things]]
Let's do some defining, but not too much.

## [[Less Basic Definitions for Rigid Creatures]]
Dealing mostly with moments of inertia.

## [[Having diagonal subcreatures for the creature]]
God I wish I were diagonal

## [[Steiner's Theorem]]
Good old Steiner, but done with some tensor algebra to make life easier.

## [[Properties of the Inertia Tensor]]
