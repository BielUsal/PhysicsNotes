# Differential Cross-sections

In this problem, it starts to make sense to define this very elusive concept. We begin by our basics:
$$dN = \text{number of particles scattered by between an angle } \theta \text{ and } \theta +d\theta$$

$$n = \text{flow of incoming particles}$$

From these basic definitions, it follows that:

$$dN = ndS = n2 \pi b db $$

We define the differential cross-section as:

$$d\sigma = \frac{dN}{n} = 2\pi b db = 2\pi b\frac{db}{d\theta}d\theta $$

This can be made more workable using solid angles:

$$d\Omega = \sin(\theta)d\theta d\varphi = 2\pi \sin\theta d\theta$$

As such, 

$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{b}{\sin\theta} \frac{db}{d\theta}$$
