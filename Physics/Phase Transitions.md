# Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena

## [[The phenomenology and classification of phase transitions]]
Systems can separate into two homogeneous parts, and that's interesting, perhaps even a bit whacky. Why? First, we have only one phase; then, it gets weird, two phases coexist (e.g., water and ice); then, it gets weirder, it goes back to one phase again! What the fuck? There could even be a 1->3->1, or even just a crazy 1->1.
