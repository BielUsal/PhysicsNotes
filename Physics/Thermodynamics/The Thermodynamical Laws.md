# The Laws

## 0th Law:
If two systems are allowed to thermally interact for long enough, they will reach thermal equilibrium. There will exist *one, and only one,* relation between their variables that will ensure this. This will be the temperature of the system.

**The 0th Law defines temperature**

## 1st Law:
There exists such a thing as *[[internal energy]]*, $U$, and it respects [[conservation of energy]].  This is represented by the very famous equation of:

$$\Delta U = Q + W $$

And, in differential form, can be written as

$$dU = \delta Q + \delta W $$
(Where the $\delta$ implies that it is not an [[exact differential]], **not** a virtual displacement.)
**First Law ensures that energy is conserved globally**
## 2nd Law:
The big boy of thermodynamics, which exists to mainly explain why some 'legal' processes happen and others don't (While it is thermodynamically legal for a hot coffee to suck out all of the heat of a room, it surprisingly doesn't happen)

There are 3 equivalent formulations of which, and two are the shittiest things anyone could possibly think of (talking about shit like engines and stuff). The other is, and I quote, *''bussin''*.

$(\Delta S)_{univ} \geq 0$

Where $S$ is the [[entropy]]
