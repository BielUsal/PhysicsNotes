# Main Representations of Hydrostatic Systems

## Entropic Representation 
We use rearrange our things and chose $S(U,V)$ to be our variable.
$$dS = \frac{1}{T}dU + \frac{P}{T}dV$$

Let's do a little bit of trolling(taking partial derivatives)

$$\frac{1}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial U}\right)_V$$
$$\frac{P}{T} = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_U$$

## Energetic Representation
Again, we use $U(S,V)$

$$dU = TdS - PdV$$

And 

$$T = \left(\frac{\partial U }{\partial S}\right)_V$$

$$-P = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_S$$
