We say that a phase transition is of **order $\bf{n}$** if it has a (finite) discontinuity on the the $n$th derivative of the Gibbs energy.  Concretely, let's talk about a monocomponent hydrostatic system. Let's assume that we have two phases, gas and liquid. Since we have a thermal, a mechanical and a material equilibrium, we know that:
$$\mu_{g}(T,P)= \mu_l(T,P)$$ And, for ease-of-use, we define $\mu = \mu_{g} = \mu_{l}$ 

## First Order
Since we know that $\bar{G}=\mu$, we can write that $d\mu = -\bar{S}dT + \bar{V} dP$ . Then, the first derivatives will be $-\bar{S} = \left(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial T}\right)_{P}$ and $\bar{V} =\left(\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial p}\right)_T$ . That is, a first order phase transition means that

$$\bar{S}_{1}(T,P) \neq \bar{S}_{2}(T,P)$$
Or

$$\bar{V_{1}}(T,P) \neq \bar{V}_{2}(T,P)$$
## Second Order
Similarly, we make the same argument and we arrive at the thermodynamic coefficients being different between the phases. This means that:

$$\alpha_{1}(T,P)\neq \alpha_{2}(T,P)$$
Or 
$$\kappa_{T1}(T,P) \neq \kappa_{T2}(T,P)$$
Or 
$$\bar{C}_{p1}(T,P) = \bar{C}_{p2}(T,P)$$
Or anything else of the sorts. Since these coefficients are related, usually there will be a discontinuity in more than one of them.
