# Basic Presentation
In a very basic sense, we will roughly cover two basic blocks in this course: Firstly, we need to finish what would be the *classical thermodynamic formalism*, which we started before. Then, we can go a little buck wild.

## Finishing the Classic Formalism
### [[Quick Review]]
Just to freshen up

### [[Phase Transitions]]
Here, we will talk about the edge cases of our systems: When they're going from one state to another, and things get a little critical.

### [[Third Law]]
In essence, we need to have some description of how things behave when it's very cold, and to start going towards a way to talk about energy and entropy instead of changes in energy and changes in entropy.

## Going Buck-Wild

### [[Some whacky (important) cycles]]

### [[Applications]]
Thermodynamics is not just about Ideal Gases, it's also about like 5 other systems. Magnetohydronamics has a very cool name! We can also talk about elastics, about bubbles, about dielectrics, about non-ideal gases, and maybe even some cycles! This will just be talking about that.

### [[Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics]]
Not all thermodynamics is about phenomena in equilibrium, but it turns out that the whole "let this be a quasi-static process" things at the beginning was important. This is where it really gets a little crazy, and we have to start developing better tools to talk about this niche topic.

### [[The microscopic interpretation]]
We do a little bit of trolling (Statistical Mechanics).
