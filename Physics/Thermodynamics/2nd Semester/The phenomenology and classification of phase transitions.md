# The phenomenology of changing phases

This is a picture of a phase diagram for a substance that contracts when freezing. It isn't easy to get a feel for it in this 3dimensional state, so it is usual to fix a certain volume and 'slice' the graph:

I.e., to understand phase transitions we need to get $p(T)$, that is, a state function that relates $p$ and $T$. The best place to look would be at the Gibbs Free Energy, since it is exactly $G(p,T)$. It probably has some useful information!

We could still put a lot more examples here.  This one doesn't even describe water, since that expands when freezing! However, the basic idea and ways to analyze it don't really change, so it'd be a wasted effort, at least to some degree.

## Classifying our wackyness:

There are 3 main ways to classify phase-transitions that make sense. The first will build upon our intuition about what *should* classify them: The Gibbs Free Energy (that, for a monocomponent system, is *basically* the chemical potential).

## The [[Ehrenfest Classification]]
Discontinuities are key to talking about phase-transition, because that is what they are at a fundamental level: Jumps.

## [[ Landau Theory]]
Here, we do not talk about derivatives but about the variables themselves. The fundamental idea is to treat phase transitions as spontaneous symmetry breaking.

## The modern [[Fisher classification|(Fisher) Classification]]
