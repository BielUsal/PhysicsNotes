This is a picture of a phase diagram for a substance that contracts when freezing. It isn't easy to get a feel for it in this 3dimensional state, so it is usual to fix a certain volume and 'slice' the graph:

I.e., to understand phase transitions we need to get $p(T)$, that is, a state function that relates $p$ and $T$. The best place to look would be at the Gibbs Free Energy, since it is exactly $G(p,T)$. It probably has some useful information!
