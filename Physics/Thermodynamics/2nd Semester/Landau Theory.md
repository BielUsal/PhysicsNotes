# Landau Theory, Classifications and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

The basic idea is that this theory works for systems that have an order parameter. We should probably define that:

**Order parameter: A variable that temperatures higher than a given cutoff ($T_c$) goes to zero and, at low temperatures has a non-zero value.**

Why is this important? Basically, the existence of an order parameter implies (spontaneous) symmetry breaking when going from high temperatures (where all the parts of the order variable 'cancel out') to low temperatures (when they mostly align). Phase-transitions are exactly where this symmetry breaks;

Therefore, we classify phase transitions into two:

## Those that have an order parameter
The shining example of this is a magnetic system, from where this theory came (Specifically, from the Ising model), since magnetization is exactly this variable that goes to 0 at high temperatures and that is non-zero at low ones.

## Those that don't
A lot.
