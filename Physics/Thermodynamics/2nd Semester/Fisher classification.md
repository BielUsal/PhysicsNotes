# The M. E. Fisher classification

The basic idea is to classify every phase transition into first order or anything else, but with a caveat:

## [[First Order Transition]]
These are transitions that have an enthalpy change during the transformation. That is,

$$\Delta \bar{H}_{\alpha \to \beta} \neq 0$$
Which, since $dP$ will always be 0 in these (for reasons outlined in the [[Ehrenfest Classification]]), will directly imply that:
$$\bar{S}_{\alpha}\neq \bar{S}_{\beta}$$
Physically, this means that two phases coexist in equilibrium with one another. Funnily enough, this is the most 'gradual' (or even continuous!) of the two. Examples of this are the solid-liquid transition, the liquid-vapor and solid-vapor transitions, and every alotropic transformation.

## Continuous Transition
In these types of transitions, there is no net change in entropy, that is:

$$\Delta \bar{H}_{\alpha \to \beta} = 0$$
Which will directly imply that:
$$\bar{S}_{\alpha}=\bar{S}_{\beta}$$

Phenomenologically, these will correspond to the non-coexistence of phases, that is sudden or abrupt changes, where it goes 'all to nothing' after the tipping point. Examplees include conductor-superconductor, superfluid-fluid and critical points.
