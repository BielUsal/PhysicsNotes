# The general case

## The Postulates of Thermodynamics
- 1st Postulate - **Equilibrium States** are macroscopically characterized by all extensive variables of the system $(U, S, N, V, \dots)$ 
- 2nd Postulate - **Existence of entropy**. There exists a function $S$ which we call entropy and it depends on every extensive parameter of any compound system, is defined for every equilibrium state and has the following property:  In absence of other constraints, the extensive parameters take values such that the maximize the entropy over the [[Geometric approach to thermodynamics|manifold of restricted equilibria states]].
- 3rd Postulate - **Properties of Entropy**. The entropy of a compound system is additive over its subsystems. It is continuous and differentiable and is monotonically increasing in energy.
- 4th Postulate - The entropy of any system goes to 0 at the state in which:
$$\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_{V,N_{i},\dots} = 0$$
That is, at 0 temperature entropy will be 0 (3rd Law).
