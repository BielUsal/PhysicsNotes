# Thermodynamic Formalism of Closed Systems
With the [[The Thermodynamical Laws|First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics]], we get a very powerful new formalism to deal with thermodynamics: One differential equation to rule them all.

However, we need to choose the variables to represent our system! The ones we choose will give us different representation. Here are the [[Main Representations of Hydrostatic Systems|main ones for hydrostatic systems]].
