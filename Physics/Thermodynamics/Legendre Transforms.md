Say you have a function of several variables, $\phi(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$, and you want to transform it into a function of the conjugate pair of $x_1$, $y_{1}= \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}$ that is, you want $p(y_{1},x_{2},\dots, x_{n})$. This is done by a Legendre Transform on $x_1$:

$$p(y_{1},x_2,\dots,x_n) = \phi - \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_1}x_1$$
