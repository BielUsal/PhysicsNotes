## Thermomechanical Coefficients
For hydrostatic systems, we define three thermomechanical coefficients. Each of these represent relations between the three variables $(P,V,T)$:

##### Cubic Dilation Coefficient:
$$\alpha = \frac{1}{v}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P$$

##### Isothermal Compressibility Coefficient:

$$\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T$$

##### Piezothermal Coefficient:

$$\beta = \frac{1}{P} \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_V$$

##### Relation between them:
$$\alpha = P \beta \kappa_T$$

## Calorimetric Coefficient

##### Calorific Coefficient at Constant Volume:
$$C_v = \left(\frac{\partial Q_{rev}}{\partial T}\right)_V = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_V$$

##### Calorific Coefficient at Constant Pressure:
$$C_p =\left(\frac{\partial Q_{rev}}{\partial T}\right)_P = \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_P + \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_p $$
Where $H = U + PV$ is the enthalpy of the system.
