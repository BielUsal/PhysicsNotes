# Internal Energy
## Definitions:
Let $W(a\to b; \Pi)$ represent the [[work]] done to get from point $a$ to point $b$ in the thermodynamical configuration space by a path $\Pi$. 

Then, let $\Pi_i$ represent an **adiabatic process**. Then, the work done will be the same for any such path:

$$W(a\to b; \Pi_i) = W_{ad}(a\to b) = f(a,b)$$

We define this function to be:

$$W_{ad}(a\to b) = U(b) - U(a)$$

We call this the Internal Energy of the system at the points $b$ and $a$

## Particular Cases
This internal energy is a function of state for the system; particularly, it will depend on the temperature and on the intensive variable.

$$U = U(T, X)$$

In particular, for a monoatomic ideal gas, our energy will be described as:

$$U = \frac{3}{2} n R T$$
