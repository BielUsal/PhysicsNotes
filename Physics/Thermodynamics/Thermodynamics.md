# Thermodynamics
In the most general terms, thermodynamics is the study of macroscopic properties of systems. More specifically, we will mostly discuss the [[equilibrium states]] of systems. As such, **time will usually never be considered**. Now, let's start enumerating!

### [[The Thermodynamic Coefficients]]

These are the *things* which we usually measure or observe, and are defined a priori for any system.
