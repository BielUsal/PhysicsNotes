# Higher Order Ordinary Differential Equations

## Classifications:

### [[Linear Higher Order ODE]]
Anything of the form 

$$a_n(x)y^{(n)}+a_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_0(x)y = f(x)$$

It's one of the one thing we can actually solve usually!

### [[Reducing the Order|Things that can be lower-ordered]]
Sometimes, you'll be lucky enough to have something that you can reduce the order of. Let's talk about them.

### Hell
If you have something slightly non-linear in basically any way that isn't carefully constructed to be an Exact Derivative's Derivative, you're fucked. Might as well grab a cactus and shove it up your ass
