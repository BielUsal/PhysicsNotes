# Euler Equations
Anything like:
$$a_n x^{n}y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} x^{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 x y' + a_0 y = 0$$

Can be transformed in a [[Linear Inhomogeneous with constant coefficient| constant coefficient]] equation with minimal effort using the transformation:

$$x = e^{t}$$

Alternatively, just guess that 
$$y = x^{k}$$

You'll get the answers.
