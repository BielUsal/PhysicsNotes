# Classification of 2nd order linear ODEs
A general homogeneous linear 2nd order ODE has the form of:

$$A \ddot{x} + B\dot{x} + Cx = 0$$

We define the discriminant of such a transformation to be:

$$\Delta =B^{2}-4AC $$

As such, we define the equation to be:

- Hyperbolic, if $\Delta >0$
- Parabolic, if  $\Delta = 0$
- Elliptic, if $\Delta < 0$
