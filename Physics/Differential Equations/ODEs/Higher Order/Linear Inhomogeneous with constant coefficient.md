# Linear Inhomogeneous Equations with Constant Coefficients:
Let our equation be of the form
$$a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_0 y = f(x)$$

Our solution will be:

$$y = y_h + y_p$$

Where $y_h$ is the solution to the homogeneous equation,

$$a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_0 y = 0$$

Which you can find by look at [[Linear homogeneous with constant coefficient|finding the solution, you lazy fuck]] :)

To find $y_p$, you look at $f(x)$ and try something that looks like it (if it is a sine, try a sine, an exponent, try an exponent, a polynomial, a polynomial, etc...)
