#  The Geometrical Picture of First Order Ordinary Differential Equations 

Before we get into the nitty-gritty details of this whole ordeal, just stare at the fucking general first order equation, you sicko.

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$$

Let's interpret this creature, this abhorrent beast: Remember, derivatives are tangent lines, so this is (secretly) telling me the slope of our curve at a point. Therefore, we could easily paint a picture of the vector field corresponding to a FOODE and realize that a solution would be a curve that is tangent to all those vectors 

This also means that for well-behaved equations (Those that follow the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]]), an initial condition (corresponding to a point in our space) will only give rise to one solution (the only one that follows from its meanderings with the geometrical condition). These can produce very beautiful pictures. As an example, let's look at:

$$yx+(x^2+y^{2})=0$$

It will produce (in mathematica) the following vector field, with one of its integral curves painted in blue:

You can get some pretty neat shit here.
