# First Order Ordinary Differential Equations 
---
## Classification Schema:
I'M GONNA CLASSIFICOOOOOOOOM


### [[First Order Linear Equation]]:
Of the form $y' + p(x)y = f(x)$. If this is the case, it'll basically be a one-liner

### Non-linear:
All kinds of fucked up. Most won't even have a method, and only special cases can be really dealt with. If you find one in the wild and it isn't any of these, you'll probably be stuck using [[numerical methods]].

##### [[First Order Exact Equation]]:
Of the form $N(x,y)y' + M(x,y) = 0$, with some strong conditions on $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$
##### [[Bernoulli Differential Equation]]:
Of the form $y' + p(x)y = q(x)y^n$

##### [[Ricatti Equation]]:
Of the form $y' = f(x) + p(x)y + q(x)y^2$

## [[Numerical Methods]] in First Order ODEs

This will be by no means extensive, it's just what I found truly necessary:

#### [[Euler's Method]]
Just do some shabung and shabang, easy to program

####
---
## Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions:
It is given by the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]]

## Geometric Considerations
Look, I would be lying if I said I even remotely knew anything about geometry, especially if it has some of those spooky words attached to it (Differential, sympletic, conformal, Riemmanian, etc...) and my good friend *Владимир Игорович Арнолдь* and his Ordinary Differential Equations book.

**HOWEVER**, first order equations have a very [[Geometry of FOODEs|natural and pretty picture]] to paint since they *do* represent first order derivatives, and, from Calc 1, we know those represent tangents.
