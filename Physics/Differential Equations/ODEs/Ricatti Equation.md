# Ricatti Equations
Ricatti equations are the little demons of the form  $y' = f(x) + p(x)y + q(x)y^2$. Say you know a particular solution of the equation, $y_1$. Then, the sub 

$$z = y - y_1$$ 

Will transform it into a [[Bernoulli Differential Equation]]. Solve that. What's that? No, I will not prove that at all.
