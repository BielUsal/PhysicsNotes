# Ordinary Differential Equations
ODEs are our bread and butter, and I'll follow a very cut-and-dry deal here. 
## Classification Schema:

#### [[First Order]]:
The most basic kind, where the highest order derivative is 1.

#### [[Second Order]]:
Say we have a mechanical situation with N degrees of freedom. [[Lagrange's Equation]] will give us N 2nd order differential equations. As such, most problems in mechanics are 2nd Order Diff. Equations, and we will then have to pay special attention to these.
#### [[Nth Order]]: 
Uhhh let's hope we can make this a second order equation.
