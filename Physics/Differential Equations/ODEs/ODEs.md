# Ordinary Differential Equations
ODEs are our bread and butter, and I'll follow a very cut-and-dry deal here. 
## Classification Schema:

#### [[First Order]]:
The most basic kind, where the highest order derivative is 1. We'll get some mileage out of this, because a lot of times higher order differential equations can be reduced to this, and you'll be happy.

#### [[Higher Order]]:
While we could focus almost exclusively on 2nd order differential equations, because physics is almost entirely that. [[Lagrange's equations]] of motion will give us N 2nd order differential equations.

So, it would make sense if we talked about them. However, it is almost trivial to generalize from 2nd into nth order, and it would be pretty dumb to limit ourselves to 2nd order for no reason.


#### [[Systems of ODEs]]
Sometimes, especially in classical mechanics, you'll get (coupled) differential equations, that is, a system of differential equations.
