# Basic Definitions

A differential equation is an equation of functions and their derivatives. Everything physics cares about is written in this language, and knowing how to solve them is going to be the topic of this whole shebang.

## Classifications (?)

As we will see, classifications can be as granular or as broad as we like, but here, we will be as broad as possible: 

#### Ordinary Differential Equations ([[ODEs]])
Ordinary Differential Equations are those that involve a **function and only one variable**. This describes a lot of the equations in physics, including most of the ones in [[Classical Mechanics]].

#### Partial Differential Equations ([[PDEs]])
Partial Differential Equations are those that describe functions which depend on more than one variable.
They're also known as the source of unhappiness for most that have to do an Initial Value Boundary Condition Problem, and we will talk about them and their various methods. [[Electrodynamics]] is almost exclusively written in its language, and is by far the place where we will encounter them the most.
